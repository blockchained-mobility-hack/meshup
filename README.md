All teams should have a team name, and maintain their code as a public repo on the Blockchained Mobility Hackathon GitHub organization. The Github team page should include a readme with the following information:

The team lead must list a mobile phone number
The platform (ethereum or IOTA)
The development tools used to build the project
SDKs used in the project
APIs used in the project
Any assets used in the project
Any libraries used in the project
Any components not created at the hackathon
All projects must be submitted as team repos with a track on the Blockchained Mobility Hackathon GitHub organization before judging begins on Sunday July 22 at 14:00. Failure to submit will result in disqualification.
All winning projects submitted will be subject to code-review. When the hackathon ends at least one member from each winning team must be available to meet with the code review team for a brief review of their submission and to confirm that their teamâ€™s Hackathon GitHub has been correctly updated. Applications will be spot checked by code reviewers. All winning projects will be code reviewed to confirm that the code is indeed original work created at the hackathon and any breach of these rules in spirit or in fact, will be grounds for disqualification either at the hackathon or ex-post facto.
